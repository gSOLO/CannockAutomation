# CannockAutomation

A test project I created way back when I was first learning C#, that's sort of morphed into a bit more than that. Facilitates home automation, detects motion and controls devices in the home (Philips Hue Lights, Wemo Devices), with voice command support from Amazon Echo and or other sources.
